### Building
- Architecting reliable backends and realtime rails for AI-heavy products.
- Prototyping and evaluating models, agents, and the systems that keep them grounded in production.
- Designing human-friendly touchpoints so the tech feels effortless.


When I'm not building, you'll find me on long walks, in the gym, or lost in music and photography.
